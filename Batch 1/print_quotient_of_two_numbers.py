#Asks the user to input the 1st number (could be a decimal)
#ask user to input 2nd number
#Compute the quotient of the two inputted numbers
#Prints the quotient

num1 = float(input("Please enter the 1st number: "))
num2 = float(input("Please enter the 2nd number: "))
print("The quotient of the 2 numbers is: ", num1 / num2)
