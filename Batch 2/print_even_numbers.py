#Prog07: Create a program that ask user to input 10 numbers. Print how many are even numbers.

# Initialize even_count to 0
# Loop 10 times to get user input
#    Ask the user to enter a number
#    Check if the number is even by: number divided by 2 == 0
#    If true, increase even_count by 1
# Print the total count of even numbers

even_count = 0

for i in range(10):
    number = int(input(f"Enter number {i + 1}: "))
    if number % 2 == 0:
        even_count += 1

print("Even numbers count:", even_count)
